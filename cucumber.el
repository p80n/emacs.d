;; ;; optional configurations
;; ;; default language if .feature doesn't have "# language: fi"
;; ;(setq feature-default-language "fi")
;; ;; point to cucumber languages.yml or gherkin i18n.yml to use
;; ;; exactly the same localization your cucumber uses
;; ;(setq feature-default-i18n-file "/path/to/gherkin/gem/i18n.yml")
;; ;; and load feature-mode
;; (require 'feature-mode)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.feature$" . feature-mode))
